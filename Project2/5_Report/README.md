    ## Introduction:
The term bi-com, is also called keyless entry or remote central locking, refers to a lock that uses an electronic remote control as a key which is activated by a handheld device or automatically by proximity.
Widely used in automobiles, an RKS performs the functions of a standard car key without physical contact. When within a few yards of the car, pressing a button on the remote can lock or unlock the doors, and may perform other functions.

## About the project:
 * Bi-com system ,is a system that is designed to remotely lock or unlock the automobiles, RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally,RKE systems implement encryption algorithms to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams.

---

## Objective
 * car must be locked  when Button is pressed ONCE
 * car must be unlocked  when Button is pressed TWICE
 * Activation/deactivation of alarm when the Button is pressed THREE times
 * car must get exposure to  light when the Button is pressed FOUR times

## State of art
 * The main focus point  is controlling the car wirelessly and remotely.
 * the second focusing point is to provide security to our car with a reliable __Encryption System__
 * New generation smart car concept for the young generation.
