## Introduction
Remote keyless entry (RKE) system & BiCom system:

The term remote keyless system (RKS), also called keyless entry or remote central locking, refers to a lock that uses an electronic remote control as a key which is activated by a handheld device or automatically by proximity.
Widely used in automobiles, an RKS performs the functions of a standard car key without physical contact. When within a few yards of the car, pressing a button on the remote can lock or unlock the doors, and may perform other functions.

while Bicom system is the extention of the unidirectional RKE to bidirectional RKE system. 
RKE transmission requires two components - a transmitter and a receiver. 
•	Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated 
•	Receiver - Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE 
2.	 RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally.
